    <!-- JG Melon -->
    <div class='loc3' id="JGMelon">
        <h2> JG Melon</h2>
        <p> JG Melon is one of my favorite places to eat in New York City. It has some of the best burgers I have had
            and is a fun place to go with friends. It has a nice atmosphere as it is always lively. The only thing is
            that it only takes cash so make sure you bring some with you.

    <!-- Natural History Museum -->
    <div class='loc4' id="NaturalHistory">
        <h2> Natural History Museum</h2>
        <p> As an engineer, I love science. This is why the Natural History Museum was always a favorite. It gives the
            history of the world through the lens of science which I enjoy. Additionally, there are many interactive
            demos throughout the museum to use which add to the enjoyment. There are many dinosaur skeletons and
            realisitic looking animal figures to learn about as well as human history.
